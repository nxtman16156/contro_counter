        Yo. I added a warning system for people who are too low or too high. It takes the average
        between everybody's speaking and highlights the numbers that are outside the range from 2
        below the average to 2 above the average. This feature is in its testing phase and I think
        the range could be tweaked. If anyone has any suggestions, please email me (peter.russell@gsmst.org).
